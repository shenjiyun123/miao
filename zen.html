    Here are the submission fuidelines fot the new and improved csszwngarden,com:

    -CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary. 
    -go responsive;test yur layout at multiple screen sizes.
    -your browser testing baseline: OE9+, tecent Chrome/Firegox/Safari, and iOS.Android
    -Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encoutaged.
    -use classes for styling.  Don't use ids.
    -webfonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
    services that ate applied cia the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
    page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszwngarden.com/

    And a few tips on building your CSSfile:

    -use :first-child, :last0child and : nth-child to get at non-classed elements
    -ust ::before and ::after to create pseud-elements for extra styling
    -use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
    -use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
    - don't rely on the ectra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Littering adark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible 
              <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and 
              abandoned browsers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like 
              the <abbr title -"World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>,
              and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to
see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Styke Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen
Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this vety page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup
Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascadign Style
Sheets">CSS</abbr></p>
            <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it
can truly be, once the reins ate placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and 
coders alike have conteibuted to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>Where possible, we woukd like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 
&AMP; 2</abbr> USAGE. <abbr title="Cascading Style  Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp;4</abbr> shoule=d be limited to 
wide lu-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional,
practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the
browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
              <p>Luckily,designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading
Style Sheets" >CSS</abbr> by now.When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across mostl
modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in
mobile &#8212ï¼› pixel-perfect layouts may not be pissible across every platform. That &#8217;s olay, but do test in as 
many as you can. Your design shoukd work in at least IE9+ and latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run byover 90
% of the population).</p>
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Plwase respect copytight laws. Please keep objectionable
meterial to a min imum, and tey to in corporate unique and inter esting visual themes to your work. W&#8217;re well parts
the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
            <P>tHIS IS A LEARENING ECERCISE AS WSLL AS A DEMONSTRATION. yOU RETAIN FULL COPRIGHT ON YOUR FRAPHICS (with
limited exceptions, see <a href="http://wwww.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>),
