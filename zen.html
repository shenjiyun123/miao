        View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and interest in participtinf!

        Here are the submission fuidelines fot the new and improved csszwngarden,com:

        -CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary. 
        -go responsive;test yur layout at multiple screen sizes.
        -your browser testing baseline: OE9+, tecent Chrome/Firegox/Safari, and iOS.Android
        -Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encoutaged.
        -use classes for styling.  Don't use ids.
        -webfonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
        services that ate applied cia the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
        page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszwngarden.com/

        And a few tips on building your CSSfile:

        -use :first-child, :last0child and : nth-child to get at non-classed elements
        -ust ::before and ::after to create pseud-elements for extra styling
        -use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
        -use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
        - don't rely on the ectra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

                    <p>
                        Littering adark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible 
                            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and 
                        abandoned browsers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the 
                            <abbr title -"World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>,
                        and the major browser creators.

                    <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of 
                        <abbr title="Cascading Styke Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen
                            Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
                            Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this vety page. The

                    <p>
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                            hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it
                            can truly be, once the reins ate placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and 
                            coders alike have conteibuted to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
            There days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
            These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
